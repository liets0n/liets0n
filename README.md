Hello üëãüèø! I am a Software developer specializing in web applications, passionate about technology and continuous learning. My journey began as a self-taught programmer, driven by the curiosity to explore the limits of programming and create solutions that could positively impact the world. Today, I turn ideas into code, always striving for growth and innovation. I also share my experiences by writing articles on Medium, where I discuss best practices and programming trends, contributing to the growth of the tech community.

Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
